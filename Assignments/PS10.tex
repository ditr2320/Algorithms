\section{Instructions}
 \begin{itemize}
	\item The solutions \textbf{must be typed}, using proper mathematical notation. We cannot accept hand-written solutions. \href{http://ece.uprm.edu/~caceros/latex/introduction.pdf}{Here's a short intro to \LaTeX.}
	\item You should submit your work through the \textbf{class Canvas page} only. Please submit one PDF file, compiled using this \LaTeX \ template.
	\item You may not need a full page for your solutions; pagebreaks are there to help Gradescope automatically find where each problem is. Even if you do not attempt every problem, please submit this document with no fewer pages than the blank template (or Gradescope has issues with it).

	\item You are welcome and encouraged to collaborate with your classmates, as well as consult outside resources. You must \textbf{cite your sources in this document.} \textbf{Copying from any source is an Honor Code violation. Furthermore, all submissions must be in your own words and reflect your understanding of the material.} If there is any confusion about this policy, it is your responsibility to clarify before the due date. 

	\item Posting to \textbf{any} service including, but not limited to Chegg, Reddit, StackExchange, etc., for help on an assignment is a violation of the Honor Code.

	\item You \textbf{must} virtually sign the Honor Code (see Section \ref{HonorCode}). Failure to do so will result in your assignment not being graded.
\end{itemize}

\section{Standard 25- Hash Tables}
\subsection{Problem \ref{Hash3}}

\begin{required} \label{Hash3}
Hash tables and balanced binary trees can be both be used to implement a dictionary data structure, which supports insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. In balanced binary trees containing $n$ elements, the runtime of all operations is $\Theta(\log n)$.  \\

\noindent For each of the following three scenarios, compare the average-case performance of a dictionary implemented with a hash table (which resolves collisions with chaining using doubly-linked lists) to a dictionary implemented with a balanced binary tree. That is, for each of the three scenarios: describe clearly in terms of big-Oh notation the average-case runtime of the dictionary implemented with a hash table, and then clearly state whether the hash table implementation is better or the balance binary tree implementation is better, and why.
	
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item A hash table with hash function $h_1(x)=1$ for all keys $x$.

\begin{proof}[Answer] $ $\\
This has a runtime of $O(n)$ because all keys are hashed to a single index, 1. This means there will be a doubly-linked list of length x. Accessing the index and then traversing the linked list takes $O(1+x)$ time which equals $O(n)$. In this case a binary search tree would be better because it has a run time of $O(log(n))$ which is better than $O(n)$. 
\end{proof}


\vskip 15pt
\item A hash table with a hash function $h_2$ that satisfies the Simple Uniform Hashing Assumption, and where the number $m$ of buckets is $\Theta(n)$ (recall that $n$ is the number of items).
\begin{proof}[Answer] $ $\\
The run time for this is constant, $O(1)$. Assuming SUHA, each index will have no linked list or a very short linked list. This is because in a perfect scenario, each item will be hashed to a unique bucket. The worst case scenario for this is $O(1+n)$ but on average the run time will be $O(1)$. Here we would choose a hash table instead of the binary search tree because $O(1)$ is better than $O(log(n))$. 
\end{proof}


\vskip 15pt	
\item A hash table with a hash function $h_3$ that satisfies the Simple Uniform Hashing Assumption, and where the number $m$ of buckets is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.

\begin{proof}[Answer] $ $\\
The run time for this this $O(1+\sqrt{n}) = O(\sqrt{n})$. If we have $n$ items and the number of buckets is $\sqrt{n}$, then on average, there will be $\sqrt{n}$ items in each linked list. For example, if we have 100 items then we have 10 buckets. Assuming each item is equally likely to be hashed to each bucket, each bucket would have a linked list with around 10 items. Therefore, searching through a given linked list has a run time of $O(1+\sqrt{n}) = O(\sqrt{n})$. Here we would choose a binary search tree because $O(log(n))$ is better than $O(\sqrt{n})$.
\end{proof}
